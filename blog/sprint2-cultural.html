                <p class="postAnswer">Senior Full-Stack Web Developer. I really want to excel at this skill.</br>
                    Find a great team to work with while being able to learn from them every day. </br> For every piece
                    of work experience I gain to be as translatable as possible to other jobs in the industry (I'm
                    sure this is the case since we all use similar tools for web dev).
                    </br> Work on large impactful projects. </br></p>

                <p class="postQuestion">A description of your own strengths and limitations</p>
                <p class="postAnswer">
                    My strengths: I work well independently, especially once I understand the big picture.
                    But, I also dive into the details and enjoy the analytical side of things - I not afraid to ask alot
                    of questions if something doesn't make sense.</br>
                    I can focus on a task for quite a long time before taking a break (~4 to 6 hours from past
                    jobs/study).</br>
                    </br>
                    My weaknesses: I sometimes find it difficult to articulate my ideas as concisely as I want to.</br>
                    I don't usually follow the exact guidelines when learning something new. I often like to jump ahead
                    to see what I'm getting into before
                    going back to the earlier steps - I feel much more comfortable after figuring out how all the pieces
                    match up.
                    This can affect my performance while working in a team if I'm limited to certain information.

                <p class="postQuestion">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your
                    workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself
                    to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
                    representatives.</p>
                <p class="postAnswer">
                    For foundations, I will be fine as I have a bit of experience from some short online courses on
                    Udemy.
                    Since I can do this remotely, there are no constraints to when I can focus on this. I really do
                    enjoy it
                    so it won't be a problem. For tougher tasks, I will be able to hack away at things until I get it
                    right,
                    otherwise there are always other students and facilitators which I will always be willing to ask for
                    help.
                    </br></br>
                    For bootcamp, I expect it to be much tougher but I enjoy learning with others, espeically in small
                    groups
                    where I can easily voice my questions and opinions. As long as I can do that, the learning should be
                    even more efficient
                    for me. I enjoy helping others as it solidifies my knowledge too and this can be easier done in
                    person.

                <p class="postAnswer">Google, then ask for help ASAP. I have no reason to hold back on questions - I'm
                    sure everybody understands that, but not everybody acts on it.

                <p class="postAnswer">To be very tolerant on providing help, not just for me, but for other students too
                    as we have a vast range of prior programming experiences. To help me learn how to learn for myself,
                    and not just to give me an answer.

                <p class="postQuestion">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to
                    other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s
                    important to plan these in.</p>
                <p class="postAnswer">Nothing during normal office hours, but I compete in national powerlifting, so
                    that training is just as important as this bootcamp to me. I can't always stay late during bootcamp
                    because of this.
