                        <pre class="postAnswer">
Senior Full-Stack Web Developer. I really want to excel at this skill.
Find a great team to work with while being able to learn from them every day.
For every piece of work experience I gain to be as translatable as possible to other jobs in the industry (I'm sure this is the case since we all use similar tools for web dev).
Work on large impactful projects.</pre>

                        <pre class="postAnswer">
My strengths: I work well independently, especially once I understand the big picture. But, I also dive into the details and enjoy the analytical side of things - I not afraid to ask alot of questions if something doesn't make sense. 

My weaknesses: I sometimes find it difficult to articulate my ideas as concisely as I want to. I don't usually follow the exact guidelines when learning something new. I often like to jump ahead to see what I'm getting into before going back to the earlier steps - I feel much more comfortable after figuring out how all the pieces match up.</pre>

                            to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community

                        <pre class="postAnswer">
For foundations, I will be fine as I have a bit of experience from some short online courses on Udemy. Since I can do this remotely, there are no constraints to when I can focus on this. I really do enjoy it so it won't be a problem. 
For tougher tasks, I will be able to hack away at things until I get it right, otherwise there are always other students and facilitators which I will always be willing to ask for help.

For bootcamp, I expect it to be much tougher but I enjoy learning with others, espeically in small groups where I can easily voice my questions and opinions. As long as I can do that, the learning should be even more efficient for me. 
I enjoy helping others as it solidifies my knowledge too and this can be easier done in person.</pre>

To be very tolerant on providing help, not just for me, but for other students too as we have a vast range of programming experiences. To help me learn how to learn for myself, and not just to give me an answer.
I have high expectations on the content that we will learn - something more than I can learn from taking online courses byself, something that will definitely help me find a job in the industry.</pre>

Nothing during normal office hours, but I compete in national powerlifting, so that training is just as important as this bootcamp to me. I can't always stay late during bootcamp because of this.</pre>
