                        <p class="postQuestion">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">Imagine you are a painter. 
HTML is the canvas and outlines, you can change it so it's a square canvas, or circular, or triangular etc
CSS is the paint and shapes, depending on how you style everything, the painting can be beautiful or horrendus even though it has the same canvas shape.</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
                            life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</p>
                        <pre class="postAnswer">Control Flow is the sequence of events that occur. Like how you accessed this webpage:
Imagine yourself as a piece of code to get to this web page, you would have to grab your mouse and click on the link to get here - this is the correct control flow, if you clicked first and THEN moved your mouse, you would have failed to get here.

Loops can be interpreted literally, it's simply a repetition of some actions:
Since you are reading this paragraph, we'll use that as an example. You don't keep telling yourself to read after every word, you are simply reading - this can be interpreted as a loop, you have decided to read this paragraph, so you are looping through the "read" command for yourself until you finish reading. You don't keep deciding "I want to read this paragraph" after every word, you simply initiate it by thinking about it and then you will read the whole thing (hopefully).
</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
                            it.</p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">The DOM represents the entirety of a webpage. Imagine large tree structure with a lot of different pieces branching off below it:
At the top, you have document, this is the underlying page of every web page, then you have the HTML right below it, which is the grouping of certain items on the screen, then branching off you'll have more specific parts of the web page like the title or the sections of the webpage. This goes all the way down to the text you are reading right now.

We interact with this DOM by applying certain styles like colors or sizing of each different piece of this tree structure:
Sometimes we just want a paragraph to be red, so, we'll change something at the very bottom of this tree strucutre. 
But, sometimes we want everything in the web page to be italics, so, we will edit a higher spot in the tree structure.</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">Arrays are simply a group of the same data: if you have apples, oranges, and bananas. You can store them as a fruits basket or ARRAY to be more organised - the first item in fruits array is apple, second item is oranges etc.

Objects are like arrays within arrays: instead of just having fruits, you now also have meats.
Since fruits and meats can't be put together, you have to store them in something like a fridge or a fridge OBJECT which can have mulitple sections - you have a fruits section and a meats section.
For fruits, you can refer to fruits by saying: go to the fridge and look into the fruits section, which you could find apples etc. 
For meats, you would do the same thing: go to the fridge and look into the meats section, you would could find steak etc.</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">Functions are basically snippits of code that you can re-use, they give you more structure. 
Imagine you're running a restaurant.
You employ staff and all of their job descriptions are just "you help me run the restaurant". Things are fine until you get a lot of customers, which is when everything falls apart since you are so unorganised. 
You reorganise these staff to give them specific 'functions' like Kitchen, Table and Admin staff. You now have an organised structure which can handle catering to a lot of customers. 
You can even employ casual staff to help during those busy times without having to micro-manage them since you can place them into specific functions.</pre>
