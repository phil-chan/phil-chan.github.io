                        <p class="postQuestion">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego
                            as a result of the core learning?</p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">That I can be pretty arrogant thinking that I can just simply spend hours and hours until I find a solution, but the better way is to simply ask for help when I hit a big roadblock. Even after I find a solution on my own, I sometimes talk about it with someone else and it lets me get a much better idea of how to do things. I should do that earlier on.</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and
                            programming?
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">You really have to be open minded in all aspects to do well and work efficiently. To connect with others you need both need to be very tolerable and understanding - they may have great advice to give you even if you don't think they can help your current project.</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
                        <pre class="postAnswer"></pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">Trying to find a new, unique answer to each question. I didn't feel like I had much meaningful reflection.</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
                            focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
                        </p>
                        <pre class="postAnswer"></pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
                            time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your
                            answer.
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">I feel like I wasn't engaged at all for the core learning questions. The programming didn't compliment these questions well enough to have meaningful reflection, especially since we're all doing this online. I also didn't know who checked the core learning content and where the requirements were, so it was easy to focus more on the practical programming side of things, which I did.</pre>

                        <p class="postQuestion">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
                            </br>
                            What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact
                            would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">I simply want to gain a very deep knowledge of programming so that I will always be and feel skillful. I think getting a job in a large organisation so I can climb their job hierarchy would be a great way to do this, I also want to write some amazing code that has really important practical uses.</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
                            Bootcamp?
                            </br>
                            Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed
                            over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do
                            you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?
                        </p>
                        <pre class="postAnswer"></pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
                            be?
                            </br>
                            While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like
                            you to consider here. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material,
                            working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">Definitely talking about myself in the reflections. I always felt like I was just repeating myself and that it was a one-sided conversation. I typed a lot, but not sure where the feedback is yet.</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
                            developed in yourself while at EDA?
                            </br>
                            At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on
                            your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
                            </br>
                            For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with
                            others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your
                            self awareness and reflective skills.
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">To be very concise, practical and kind in my communication for general work and programming chat. If I can improve this skill then I think I could be a great team leader.</pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
                            </br>
                            Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
                            </br>
                            Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should
                            include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely
                            with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">Since we have IRL contact with the facilitators and other students, it's infinitely more accessible to ask questions and do peer reviews. We will all learn a lot just by being in the same physical space.</pre>
