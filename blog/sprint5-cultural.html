                            time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your

                            </br>
                            What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact
                            would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
                        </p>
                        <pre class="postAnswer"></pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
                            Bootcamp?
                            </br>
                            Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed
                            over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do
                            you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?
                        </p>
                        <pre class="postAnswer"></pre>
                        <p class="postQuestion">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
                            be?
                            </br>
                            While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like
                            you to consider here. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material,
                            working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.

                        <p class="postQuestion">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
                            developed in yourself while at EDA?
                            </br>
                            At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on
                            your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
                            </br>
                            For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with
                            others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your
                            self awareness and reflective skills.
                        </p>

                        <p class="postQuestion">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
                            </br>
                            Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
                            </br>
                            Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should
                            include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely
                            with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
