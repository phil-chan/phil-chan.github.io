            <h1>The Story of Te Houtaewa (PAGE heading)</h1>
            <h2>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the
                speediest
                runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h2>
            <h3>10 November 2010</h3>

            <p>
              Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning
              his
              mother
              wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short
              distance
              away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te
              Rarawa
              people
              who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey
              over
              the
              hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up
              properly.
              On
              reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes)
              situated
              at
              the
              foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was
              immediately
              recognised.
