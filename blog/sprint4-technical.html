                        <p class="postQuestion">Pseudocode</p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">I understand this fully, but haven't had many chances to actually use it.</pre>

                        <p class="postQuestion">Trying something
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">If this means just testing code and deleting it to see if something new works, then I always do this. I'd code a solution I think would work, check it and play around with it a little bit while using console.log() to see if I get my desired result, then I'll pick pieces of it I like into my final code.</pre>

                        <p class="postQuestion">Rubber ducky method
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">I talk out loud a little bit when I try to parse a lot of information at once. This kind of replaces using pseudocode for me.</pre>

                        <p class="postQuestion">Reading error messages
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">I feel pretty confident in using the messages, especially when combined with console.log(). I'm usually able to figure it out if I can at least replicate the error elsewhere.</pre>

                        <p class="postQuestion">Console.logging
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">These two words have been ingrained into my head. I've probably used it hundreds of times already. This is my bread and butter.</pre>

                        <p class="postQuestion">Googling
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">I always Google if there are already in-built methods for the code I want to write. I get a lot of ideas from Stack Overflow as well, it really gets the ball rolling for me.</pre>

                        <p class="postQuestion">Asking your peers for help
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">I haven't had much chance to ask for help. I've been able to find all my answers independently(?) through already existing Google/Stack Overflow posts. I will be asking the facilitators and my peers a lot during bootcamp when that method is more accessible though. I ended up getting one suggestion from a friend outside of the course who doesn't do much programming, but that one suggestion allowed me to refactor a certain piece of code from ~12 lines to a single line of code.</pre>

                        <p class="postQuestion">Asking coaches for help
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">Haven't had to ask them for help yet, I've been able to find all my answers pretty quickly. There's only been one massive roadblock for 2 of the katas on Repl.it, but I ended up getting through it anyway.</pre>

                        <p class="postQuestion">Improving your process with reflection
                        </p>
                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">Doing the reflection straight after doing all the tasks in the sprint is much better. I can fully reflect since all those new concepts are still fresh in my mind. And I feel like I am able to add better reflection answers since the contents of the sprints are getting more and more interesting.</pre>
