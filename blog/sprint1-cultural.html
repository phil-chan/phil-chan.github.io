According to the Myers Briggs personality test, I have "very low EQ" since my result was INTJ. I don't think that's
case all the time, but I guess I can build on this during bootcamp if it's an issue. I will have to connect with people
alot, so this will be fixed if it's an issue anyway.</pre>

                            work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies
                            you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
                            strategies you would try now, and why.
