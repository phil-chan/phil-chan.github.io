Limitations are that I need to develop my EQ so that I can help myself and others excel rather than just 'do well'. It also helps to get new perspectives on problems so I can find better solutions than I could have found indepdently.</pre>

I don't think that's case all the time, but I guess I can build on this during bootcamp if it's an issue. I will have to connect with people alot, so this will be fixed if it's an issue anyway.</pre>

                            work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies
                            you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
                            strategies you would try now, and why.
                        </p>
                        <pre class="postAnswer">At my previous job, a co-worker and I were working on a project and they wanted to make some technical changes, which only I could do since they weren't technically skilled, but they had the contextual knowledge.
The issue was that when we met up, we sat together and they wanted me to make the changes during the meeting - these changes took a few minutes each as the requests were really unorganised.
I argued that we should end the meeting, them to jot down the list of changes and then send it to me so we could do it much quicker. They refused. I tolerated it knowing that after 20 minutes or so, they would understand how inefficient their method was.
After a while, they finally agreed to end the meeting. So, after an hour or so they came back with a list of changes and I was able to implement these changes within the hour. They apologised after that, I said it was fine and that it was my fault that I couldn't be more convincing my argument.

The strategy was to simply show them the inefficiency because I couldn't convincingly explain it to them. I initially tried to communicate it, but when it didn't work I guided them to it through practical means. It was effective given that our end result was a good one for work and relationship. It helped us understand each other more.

A strategy I would try now is the prepare for this by asking the person I am meeting with to give me more details of what will be discussed. This way, we can both approach the meeting with an open mind and I will have prepared practical examples to support my arguments.
