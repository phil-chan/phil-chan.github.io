                            class="postAnswer">Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to rewire itself in response to experiences or injury. For example, people who lose a portion of their brain (to cancer, for example) can sometimes redevelop the functions of that part of the brain in another part of their brain. It effects are greatest in children, but continue throughout life.
   
I can take advantage of neuroplasticity by simply exposing myself to new experiences with an open mind, such as learning code.

This ability can be improved by getting enough sleep and conciously reminding myself of why I am doing something. Having a strong sense of purpose is most important because it widens your scope of learning while also pinpointing a narrow goal.

                            How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</br>

                            class="postAnswer">In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” (Dweck, 2015)

It's relevant to this bootcamp not only because of all the new programming skills we're learning, but because of the soft-skills as well. Developing our soft-skills indirectly helps us attain a growth mindset as we learn how to better understand and learn from each other.

I feel like I've always had a growth mindset by default because of my curious nature, and programming is something that can maximally pull that out of me.
