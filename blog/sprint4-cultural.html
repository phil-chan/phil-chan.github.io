                            class="postAnswer">Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to rewire itself in response to experiences or injury. For example, people who lose a portion of their brain (to cancer, for example) can sometimes redevelop the functions of that part of the brain in another part of their brain. It effects are greatest in children, but continue throughout life.
   
I can take advantage of neuroplasticity by simply exposing myself to new experiences with an open mind, such as learning code.
This ability can be improved by getting enough sleep and conciously reminding myself of why I am doing something. Having a strong sense of purpose is most important because it widens your scope of learning while also pinpointing a narrow goal.</pre>
