                        <pre
                            class="postAnswer">Emotional intelligence is a thought model that claims that to be successful, people must be able to know their own feelings. They must also be able to guess and influence the emotions of other people, and of groups of other people. There are several different models that disagree about the exact definition of the term. Even though there does not seem to be an exact definition, the model itself can be applied in various ways, across different domains.</pre>

                        </h3>
                        <pre class="postAnswer">IQ is a comparative measure: it tells one how much above or below the average a person is. IQ scores can tell some things about a person, as well as intelligence. This is because intelligence is linked to other aspects of life.

IQ scores are used in various ways:
to predict a person's educational achievement or special needs.
to tell what kind of jobs a person could probably do.
to study what the IQ scores of a population are like.
to study what other things about a person are related to his IQ.</pre>
